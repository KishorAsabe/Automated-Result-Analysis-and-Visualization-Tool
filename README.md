# Automated Result Analysis and Visualization Tool

## Overview

The **Automated Result Analysis and Visualization Tool** is a comprehensive solution developed for the IT faculty at Dr. D.Y. Patil College of Engineering (DYPCOE), Akurdi. This tool automates the process of extracting, analyzing, and visualizing student results, significantly reducing manual effort and minimizing errors.

## Problem Statement

Each semester, DYPCOE receives student results in long PDF files containing the entire list of students and their subject-wise marks. The manual process of transferring data from these PDFs into Excel sheets for analysis is time-consuming and prone to errors. With over 150+ students, this process takes faculty members days to complete and often leads to inaccuracies.

To address this, we developed an automated tool that converts PDF results into Excel format and provides detailed, accurate analysis. This tool has reduced the processing time from **one day to less than two minutes** and is currently used by 2nd, 3rd, and 4th-year IT faculty members.

## Key Features

### 1. Data Conversion

- **Automated Data Extraction:** The tool uses **pattern matching** techniques to accurately extract student names, subject codes, and marks from university result PDFs.
- **PDF-to-Excel Conversion:** The extracted data is automatically converted into an Excel file for easier handling and further analysis.
  
### 2. Result Analysis and Visualization

Once the PDF data is converted, the tool offers in-depth analysis and visualizations to help faculty understand the results better.

**Features of the Visualization Tool:**
- **Result Analysis Visualization:** Provides visual insights into the result data using pie charts to assist non-technical faculty members in interpreting the results.
- **Subject-Wise Result Analysis:** Detailed analysis of each subject, including pass fail rates, average marks, and highest/lowest scores.
- **Get Topper Details:** Highlights the top students based on overall performance  making it easier to acknowledge their achievements.

### 3. Help and Feedback Section

Weâ€™ve also incorporated a **Help & Feedback** section, allowing faculty members to:
- Access documentation and tutorials on how to use the tool.
- Submit feedback or report any issues they encounter.
- Directly contact the development team for future updates or support.
